# Modelresolvers

Modelresolvers is a Python GraphQL package, inspired by [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/), on top of [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry)
to structure your project by feature like entity instead of operation type which means mutation and query to manage it easier.
